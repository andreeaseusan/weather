      <h2>Description + Types of data</h2>
      <p class="bioText">  If a box plot and a density plot had a baby, it would be a violin plot. To understand violin plot, its’ useful to first refresh your memory on what a box plot is. While a box plot is good for showing summary statistics (i.e. median, range, quartiles) of a continuous variable, it doesn’t show variation in the data. Density plots, on the other hand, show the distribution of the continuous variable. A violin plot uses continuous numerical data (e.g. weight, hours) and adds distribution data to the information that a box plot would normally display. See the “Build your own” section for a more in-depth description of a violin plot. <br><br> <h2>Build your own</h2> <p class="bioText"> On the y axis, is the continuous variable (e.g. cholesterol level). On the x axis, if applicable, is the category (i.e. different medication types). The dot represents the median (middle value) of the data. The thin bar is commonly referred to as the 95% confidence interval but it seems that the interpretation is actually the range of values within which 95% of values lie. The thick bar is the interquartile rage (the difference between the first and third quartile, so the middle 50 values). Finally the outline of the violin shape represents the frequency with which certain values appear in the data (the wider the section of the violin, the higher frequency of that value in the data). R and Stata are commonly used to build violin plots, however it can also be done using other software packages and languages such as Python or JavaScript. <br><br> <h2>Advantages and disadvantages</h2><p class="bioText"> Advantages and disadvantages: As mentioned above, violin plots are an improvement from the traditional boxplot because it adds richness in terms of the distribution of the data. For instance, you can see if a distribution is multimodal, which you cannot see in a box plot. A disadvantage, however, is that violin plots are less popular, meaning that most people are not familiar with them and may struggle with their interpretation. <br><br> <h2>History</h2><p class="bioText"> In their 1998 publication titled “Violin Plots: A box plot-density trace synergism”, Hintze and Neslon propose the violin plot as an improvement to Tukey’s box plot conceived in 1977.  The authors insist that that the Violin plot retains the information communicated by a box plot while adding information about the shape of the distribution. Fun fact: the name “violin plot” emerged because the first analysis produced a shape that looked like a violin.
